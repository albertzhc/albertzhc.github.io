It is generally true that questions are required to learn new stuff. Raise a question, analyse it, collect materials and finally solve it. This is the best way to learn and this method would apply to the future problems. That is why Einstain says 'What is left when we forgot what we have learnt is education'.

Depending on this principle, I list my questions here for further study. Some of them are too hard for me, some are vague and not well defined. Any way, since it's a private space, and is not showing to any one els or disturbed by other's opinion, whenever an idea has raised in my mind, it is listed here.

1. What is the purpose of life?
Why am I living here. Why is any body live here. According to the theory of evolution, we are some slave of our gene. The only purpose is to survive as a species, not much left for an individual. 

2. If life is meaningless, what attitude should I hold to live on?
My answer is _Happyness_. To maximise my own happiness. But this is not an easy work.

## Things are not like before

Recently, something is bothering me. I can't identify what it is, but it is really drawing me back. It is dragging me into the deep sea. I can't breath. I have not energy to finish any work, even if I know that this job is very important.

I feel that my life is not orgnized. My time is just flying by and nothing happened to it. I feel like that I am not important.

On one hand, I am worried about the progress because there is really something very urgent. On the other hand, I don't want to start to work on them because they are hard to me and I am suffering working on them.

Is everyone's life the same? Why it is so hard. I just want to do something I am good at, earn some money and live happily with my family. Is it so hard?

I chose the hard way.

## Tomorrow is a new start

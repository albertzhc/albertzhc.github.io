Next Thursday is the second APR for me, which means I have been working on this PhD. research for two years. Events like this always remind me how time flies. There are only 1.5 years to go for my project. Hoping to get a good result at the end, I need to devote more energy to my research.

I am facing some problems recently: 1) I am reluctant to start working. I am always delaying tasks to the very end to begin with. I know it is bad, and causing a lot of anxiety to myself. But I just can not.

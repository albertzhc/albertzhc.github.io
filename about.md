This is my personal diary. It is not intended to be seen by others.

It is deeply hiden in the sea of internet. If fate brought you here, my friend, then you are welcome.

I have nothing to offer, except for my happiness, my worry and my heart. This is like a playground for me. I do not need to consider whether this is important. And I do not need to think about my words and grammers. I just want this place to express my self, to flow the work under the keyboard very quickly. I want my typing skill to be practiced. And I want to think faster as I am typing faster. I envy my supervisor, he seems excellent with his work and he can do most of his job easily and effectively. He is very familiar with his tools. I want to learn from him, and I want to be as good as him. He is the model to me now.

Sometimes, I am thinking what can make me happy. I think the most important thing is that I know what I am doing, I am good at this work and I know this is important and valuable for the world.

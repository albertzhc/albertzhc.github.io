What I did in a week. How much work could I do in one day. This is a real problem. Which is because of that efficiency is everything.

My routine is listen to 'dedao' in the morning while showering or making breakfast. 
Then is the morning time. 9 am to 12 am. This time is precious, but is always wasted.
Then lunch, need almost 1 hour.
1 pm to 6 pm should be the most effective time. Whole chunck of time rested here.
Then dinner, which also takes 1 hour, sometimes more.
Evening time seems the longest, but easy to loose.


<!-- My diary is almost babling, not targeted on any problem. The problem faced writing is critical when writing an article which is valuble for the others.
Let's make an example.

Today I played _Bloodborn_ again after almost 2 years for the first time. Bloodborn is an excellent game, a very competive one for the best game in my opinon. (The other two are Witcher and Zelda) I would like to tell you why it is a good game, and why I recommend you to play it.

Bloodborn is an ARPG game, which means it focus on telling a story, and the character is controlled by the player in an action way. As the name showed, the story is dark, nasty and cruel. There is a town which is famouse for blood cure. One day, no one knows why, some of the residents turn into monsters. The player is a forgein hunter, whose job is to kill all the monsters and find out the reason.

At the beginning, you know nothing more than the above two sentences. All the clue to the fact is hiden in fragmented messages, which could be a piece of paper lost on the floor, a word brought up by anybody else or a description of an item. To find out the secrete, the player needs to study these messages really carefully.

If you ask any one who have played this game, he would tell you it's hard. Any creature on the road could slave you, each boss could be a nightmare. The experience could be called suffuring without any exaggeration. Then why I advise you to suffur, you ask. That's because it's also fancinating. Yes, it is hard, but everytime you defeat a boss, you know that you are stronger, not because your character level up, but yourself. You will be sure that you are more skillful to face a stronger enemy. And whats more, the picture is attractive. Not to say it's beautiful or splended,

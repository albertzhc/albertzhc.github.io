This is a draft of my blog
I can say anything here and it won't be published.

Publish is a interesting word. It means deliver things to the public. But in recent days, something is published does not mean it `will` be seen by the public, it only means it `could` be. The huge difference between these two words is that the massive internet information makes the public unable to see your self-published stuff. In this case, publish means hiding, means you are still alone among people in internet.
